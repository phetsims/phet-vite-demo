phet-vite-demo
================

Testing out using Vite with PhET code. Does NOT rely on the PhET transpiler, just needs the relevant directories checked out adjacent to this repo.

TODO: Give explicit instructions.

`npx vite serve` at the root of the project to start the server, then navigate to the URL (e.g. http://localhost:5173/).

`npx vite build` to build the project (can then be served from the `dist` directory).

`npx eslint .` to lint.
